# FLIGHT UI
## HOW TO RUN

To start the React application, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies first
npm start          # Start the development server
```

After running these commands, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000

The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.
